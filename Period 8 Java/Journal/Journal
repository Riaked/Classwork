May 4th
	Today I have played a little bit of boxhead in order to refresh myself of
	the many features the game has to offer. I have refreshed my memory of the game,
	they layout, the guns etc. For the next class session I will, together with my group, 
	work on this project. Although, my group is also thinking about changing what we are doing
	so we might talk about that in the next class session

May 5th
	Today my group talkled about exactly what we wanted to do for the symposium. 
	We have decided on doing a pokemon mystery dungeon esque game but with different 
	features and battle system from fire emblem or final fantasy.
	My goal for Monday will be able to get my first class, the unit and it's contstructor
	finished.
May 8th
	I have started in the battle method which is just a rough draft of what the actual method
	will be like. There will most likely be changes to the method in order to actually cooperate with
	Richard's code. I have a few other methods that I need to work on in order to get the battle method
	to actually make any sort of sense. My goal for tomorrow will be to finish those methods, and 
	provided that Richard has finished making the different types of Characters, my methods may or 
	may not be finished.
