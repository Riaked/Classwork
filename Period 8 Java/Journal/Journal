May 4th
	Today I have played a little bit of boxhead in order to refresh myself of
	the many features the game has to offer. I have refreshed my memory of the game,
	they layout, the guns etc. For the next class session I will, together with my group, 
	work on this project. Although, my group is also thinking about changing what we are doing
	so we might talk about that in the next class session

May 5th
	Today my group talkled about exactly what we wanted to do for the symposium. 
	We have decided on doing a pokemon mystery dungeon esque game but with different 
	features and battle system from fire emblem or final fantasy.
	My goal for Monday will be able to get my first class, the unit and it's contstructor
	finished.
May 8th
	I have started in the battle method which is just a rough draft of what the actual method
	will be like. There will most likely be changes to the method in order to actually cooperate with
	Richard's code. I have a few other methods that I need to work on in order to get the battle method
	to actually make any sort of sense. My goal for tomorrow will be to finish those methods, and 
	provided that Richard has finished making the different types of Characters, my methods may or 
	may not be finished.
May 9th
	I have learned key listener which will enable us to move the character sprite throughout
	the overworld as well as allow us to enable pop up text and screen switching through the 
	keyboard instead of the mouse. I have also made a super class called Character which will implement
	two interfaces called Player and Enemy which will help out my battle method. My goal for tomorrow will
	be to continue working on the rest of the methods, and help Richard with the Character class.
May 10th
	I have helped Richard create the Character class and have begun building the methods inside the class.
	I have made the setStats, getStats, getName, and setName getters and setters for the super class
	Character. This will allow my battle methods to get the names and the stats of the character in order 
	to calculate the outcome of each and every battle to succession. My goal for tomorrow would to finish up this
	class so my battle method would finish.
May 11th
	I have *almost* finished the Character class, and have successfully called the stats and the moves from
	the player character. This makes my battle class easier to code because I now know that I can reliably 
	get the stats and the moves in order to make the battle go smoothly. With Richard, we have also 
	implemented the level up system, and adjusting stats accordingly. My goal for tomorrow would be to finish up 
	the Character class, and the Enemy interface.
May 12th
	I spent today drawing the 5th level of our game, and making a new class Monster which will be used for
	all the monsters. This will give Joey a look at what he has to code for our project. My goal for Monday 
	will be to finish up the Monster Class.
May 13th
	I have helped Richard create the Monster Class and now it is working as intended. I can now get the monster
	stats and moves. This helps my battle class because I can finally start working on it now that I can grab
	both monster and player stats and moves to be able to calculate the outcome of each battle. My goal for
	next time will be to finish up my battle class so we can actually test the results of battles and get the
	battle system ongoing.
