May 4th
Today I have played a little bit of boxhead in order to refresh myself of
the many features the game has to offer. I have refreshed my memory of the game,
they layout, the guns etc. For the next class session I will, together with my group, 
work on this project. Although, my group is also thinking about changing what we are doing
so we might talk about that in the next class session
